# [where's bosch?](https://seanstephenbrian.github.io/wheres-bosch/)

**there's much to find in the garden of earthly delights**

*where's bosch?* is a 'where's waldo?'-inspired web game built with react and firebase, featuring hieronymus bosch's triptych painting *the garden of earthly delights*, as well as other works by bosch.

in addition to the complex user interface and detailed original design, one noteworthy aspect of this project 
is that item locations are securely stored on google firebase and accessed as necessary to confirm the validity of user clicks. player leaderboard data is also stored on firebase.

custom fonts are by medievalist and font designer [peter baker](https://github.com/psb1558).
